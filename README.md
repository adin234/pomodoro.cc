# Boost your productivity
##Â Manage your time more effectively

[Pomodoro.cc](http://pomodoro.cc) is an online time tracking tool to plan and review the tasks for the day.

It takes advantage of the guidelines described in the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com) to work more effectively with frequent, mind-refreshing breaks.

With the help of insightful statistics, you'll be able to better understand how much time you spent on each task and how focused you were.

# Development environment setup (vagrant, docker)

To setup a development machine you'll need:

- **vagrant** 1.7.4
- **virtualbox** 5.0.6
- **nodejs** 4.2.1, **npm** 3

*Note*: setup works with these versions, previous version might also work.


### bootstrap

Run the following to bootstrap the environment (install the needed dependencies, setup docker, build the images).
Grab a coffee in the meantime, this takes about 2-5 minutes

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
opt/bootstrap
vagrant up
```

Add an entry in your `/etc/hosts`:

```
192.168.11.2    pomodoro.dev
```


### authentication (optional)

If you want authentication on `http://pomodoro.dev` to work, you'll need to provide the necessary tokens (from the github and twitter developer panel) in the `credentials.json`.

### boot development environment

Boot up the vagrant, grab another coffee:

```
vagrant up
```


# Helpful information during local development

Run these script from inside vagrant. (Located under `/pomodoro.cc`)

### To rebuild the infrastructure

`opt/docker.restart DEV`

or

- `opt/docker.build`
- `opt/docker.rm`
- `opt/docker.run`


The `DEV` flag is used in the container that holds the web application's front-end,
so that you can see the changes reflected in a couple of seconds, without relaunching the script.

Also it opens a fake authentication route `/auth/fake` used for E2E testing.

### List running containers

with `docker ps`


### Logs

run `docker ps` to get a list of the running processes and `docker logs -f [container id]` for a live output.





#### [SSL certificate](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self) and credentials

*This is handled by `opt/bootstrap` automatically, there should be no need to run this.*

You can override the self-signed certificate with (put the files in the `ssl` directory) :

```
openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out pomodoro.cc.pass.key 2048
openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in pomodoro.cc.pass.key -out pomodoro.cc.key
openssl req -new -key pomodoro.cc.key -out pomodoro.cc.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in pomodoro.cc.csr -signkey pomodoro.cc.key -out bundle.crt
```
